# Tic-Tac-ToeApp

This repo is my build about a Angular App about Tic-Tac-Toe to learn more about Typescript, HTML, CSS and and of course, JavaScript.
Also, it was a good challenge to learn about Angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
